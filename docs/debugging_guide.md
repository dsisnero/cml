# CML Debugging Guide

This guide explains how to use the CML tracing system to debug code that is not working as expectedâ€”whether due to logic bugs, race conditions, or performance issues.

## Overview

CML's tracing system provides deep visibility into event registration, commit/cancel outcomes, fiber context, and channel operations. It is designed for both correctness debugging and performance analysis.

## Enabling Tracing

Compile with the `-Dtrace` flag to enable all trace points:

```bash
crystal run your_program.cr -Dtrace
```

## Using User-Defined Tags

Add a `tag:` argument to any `CML.trace` call to group or filter trace output:

```crystal
CML.trace "Chan.register_send", value, pick, tag: "chan"
CML.trace "Pick.committed", event_id, value, tag: "pick"
```

Tags help you focus on specific operations or code regions.

## Filtering Trace Output

Filter trace output by tag, event type, or fiber:

```crystal
# Only show traces with the tag "chan" or "pick"
CML::Tracer.set_filter_tags(["chan", "pick"])

# Only show traces for a specific event type
CML::Tracer.set_filter_events(["Chan.register_send", "Pick.committed"])

# Only show traces for a specific fiber (by name or id)
CML::Tracer.set_filter_fibers(["my_fiber_name"])
```

## Redirecting Trace Output

By default, trace output goes to STDOUT. Redirect it to a file or any IO:

```crystal
CML::Tracer.set_output(File.open("trace.log", "w"))
```

## Debugging Scenarios

### 1. Finding Stuck or Slow Events
- Tag and filter all send/receive operations on a channel.
- Look for missing or delayed `committed`/`cancelled` outcomes.

### 2. Diagnosing Race Conditions
- Assign fiber names with `CML::Tracer.set_fiber_name("worker1")`.
- Filter traces by fiber to see interleaving and event order.

### 3. Verifying Correctness
- Trace all `Pick.committed` and `Pick.cancelled` events.
- Ensure only one event in a choice is committed (CML invariant).

### 4. Reducing Trace Noise
- Use tags and event filters to focus on the subsystem or operation of interest.
- Redirect output to a file for offline analysis.

## Real-World Trace Usage Examples

### Example 1: Debugging a Stuck Channel
Suppose a sender or receiver is stuck and not completing:

```crystal
CML.trace "Chan.register_send", value, pick, tag: "chan"
CML.trace "Chan.send_committed", value, pick, tag: "chan"
CML.trace "Chan.send_cancelled", value, pick, tag: "chan"
CML::Tracer.set_filter_tags(["chan"])
CML::Tracer.set_output(File.open("trace.log", "w"))
```

Run your program and inspect `trace.log` for missing or delayed `send_committed` events.

### Example 2: Tracking a Specific Fiber
If you want to follow a particular fiber's actions:

```crystal
CML::Tracer.set_fiber_name("worker1") # Call at fiber start
CML.trace "Pick.committed", event_id, value, tag: "pick"
CML::Tracer.set_filter_fibers(["worker1"])
```

### Example 3: Isolating a Subsystem
If you have multiple subsystems, tag each:

```crystal
CML.trace "Timer.start", timer_id, tag: "timer"
CML.trace "MVar.put", value, tag: "mvar"
CML::Tracer.set_filter_tags(["timer"])
```

### Example 4: Debugging Choice Outcomes
To ensure only one event in a choice is committed:

```crystal
CML.trace "Pick.committed", event_id, value, tag: "pick"
CML.trace "Pick.cancelled", event_id, tag: "pick"
CML::Tracer.set_filter_tags(["pick"])
```

Check that for each choice, only one `committed` event appears per group of related event IDs.

## Best Practices
- Use tags to isolate and group related trace points.
- Filter by tag or event to reduce noise and focus on the problem.
- Use fiber names to track specific concurrent operations.
- Always disable tracing in production for zero overhead.
