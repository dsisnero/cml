{"id":"cml-5ql","title":"Fix terminal display system flashing/garbage rendering issue","description":"The terminal display system (examples/display_system/terminal_display.cr) ported from Chapter 8 of Concurrent Programming in ML has rendering issues:\n\n1. **Flashing screen**: Terminal output flashes rapidly, making it hard to see\n2. **Garbage characters**: Display shows random/incorrect characters\n3. **Incomplete rendering**: Only the menu appears at bottom, windows not drawn properly\n\n**Files to modify**:\n- examples/display_system/terminal_display.cr (main rendering logic)\n- examples/display_system/display.cr (interface definitions)\n- examples/display_system/simple_terminal_demo.cr (test/demo code)\n\n**Implementation steps**:\n1. Add proper terminal clearing/positioning (ANSI escape codes)\n2. Implement double buffering to prevent flashing\n3. Fix buffer management in TerminalBitmap#render\n4. Ensure draw operations correctly update screen buffer\n5. Verify coordinate transformations for nested windows\n6. Add debug logging to trace rendering flow\n\n**Example before**: Terminal flashes, shows garbage, only menu visible\n**Example after**: Stable display with windows, borders, cursor, and interactive menu","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-19T15:09:09.874608-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-19T15:29:13.786067-07:00","closed_at":"2025-12-19T15:29:13.786067-07:00","close_reason":"Fixed by removing debug puts, implementing line-clearing instead of full screen clear, and fixing buffer management. Minor text rendering bug remains (overlap of button text)."}
